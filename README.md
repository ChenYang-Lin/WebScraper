<h1>After Cloning Repository</h1>
At the root directory in terminal. run <b>npm i</b> command to install all node modules used in this project.
then run <b>npm start</b> to start server. The website will be up and running on localhost port 3000. So go to <b>http://localhost:3000/</b> to see results.

It takes some time for server to srape events. If you visit localhost:3000 immediately after the server starts, you may see a sentence telling you to revisit later.
If you visit localhost:3000 immediately after the server starts, you may see a sentence telling you to revisit later.

For testing purposes, after you start the server, you will see a blue chromium icon pop up and start scraping. When the blue chromuim browser is closed, refresh or revisit localhost, and a list of upcoming events will be displayed on the website.

Keep in mind that you may see multiple blue chromuim brosers running at the same time. This is normal because we scheduled to run a scraping every minute for testing purposes. As long you don't manually close the browser, everything will proceed normally.
