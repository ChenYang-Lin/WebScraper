For testing purposes, after you start the server, you will see a blue chromium icon pop up and start scraping. When the blue chromuim browser is closed, refresh or revisit localhost, and a list of upcoming events will be displayed on the website.
<br>
Keep in mind that you may see multiple blue chromuim brosers running at the same time. This is normal because we scheduled to run a scraping every minute for testing purposes. As long you don't manually close the browser, everything will proceed normally.
